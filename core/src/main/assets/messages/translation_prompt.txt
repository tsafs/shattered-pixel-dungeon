I'm developing an RPG game where the game mode can either be softcore or hardcore.
Translate these sentences and keep the variables in English:
windows.wndgameinprogress.game_mode=Game Mode
windows.wndgameinprogress.softcore=Softcore
into these languages:
chinese, vietnamese, ukrainean, turkish, russian, portoguese, polish, dutch, korean, japanese, italian, indonesian, hungarian, french, spanish, greek, german, czech
Return only a list with the language followed by the actual variable name and the translation, like this:
1. <language>: actors.hero.hero.try_again=<translation>
Replace <language> with the actual language and <translation> with the corresponding translation. Work step by step.
